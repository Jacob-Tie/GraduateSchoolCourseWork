# Brief descriptions of all the files:
## Synchonized_Neural_Networks_Project_Tiede_Jacob.ipynb
This was the final project for my Computational Neuroscience course. In it I follow the derivations of a paper and extend the idea. Additionally I coded some neural networks to illustrate results.
## STAT5000SP2020_Project_Jacob_Tiede.ipynb
This was the final project for my statistics course. The problems involve many datasets, all of which I've tried to include in this repo, but if any are missing let me know.
