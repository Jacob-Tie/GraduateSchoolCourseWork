    "# Biweekly Check-in 2: LSTMs and TabNet\n",
    "# Jacob Tiede\n",
    "## Working with Text Data:\n",
    "For this week I wanted to get some experience working with two new kinds of data: sequential data and tabular data. To this end I will start this report by working with text data. I will be working with data found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data?select=train.csv, which is a dataset for disaster classification of tweets, but before we get to that let's look at a state of the art neural net used for these kinds of problems: a long-term short-term memory (LSTM) neural network.\n",
    "## LSTMs\n",
    "I'll start by reviewing an article on LSTMs found here: https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21. This article mentions that LSTMs are a slightly modified version of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), so it is worth taking a brief aside to research these as well:\n",
    "### Aside: RNNs\n",
    "For this section I will be using this article as a guide: https://towardsdatascience.com/recurrent-neural-networks-d4642c9bc7ce. The article details that RNNs seek to solve 2 important problems with conventional neural nets and series data. The first being the shape of the input to an RNN need not be a fixed number, and the second being that an RNN can find relationships in a temporal sense (i.e. it can establish a relationship between inputs that it receives at different time steps). The first is solved by only applying a weight matrix $W_x$ (and presumably a non-linearity) to a small part of the input (maybe a single word for text classification) which will then give what is called the \"hidden state\" of that portion of the input. This is then multiplied with another weight matrix $W_y$ (and non-linearity) to give the first output. Since $W_x$ and $W_y$ stay the same for every input this scheme can be used on inputs of arbitrary size. The second problem (of remembering prior inputs in time) is solved by adding a third weight matrix $W_h$ which takes the hidden state for the previous input and adds $W_h*hidden-state-activation$ to the hidden state of the next input. More concretely, for the nth input to this scheme our hidden state $h_n$ would be $g_1(W_hh_{n-1})+g_2(W_xx_n)$ where $x_n$ is the nth input, and $g_1$ and $g_2$ are functions. This means that as we parse through the input we are propagating the prior hidden states through the neural network. It is worth noting that this is describes a unidirectional RNN, but there is such a thing as a bidirectional RNN (which calculates 2 hidden states, one which will propagate backwards and one the propagates forward), but these are not relevant to our discussion of LSTMs at this time.\n",
    "### Back to LSTMs\n",
    "Moving back to the original article (https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21) we can see that LSTMs are attempting to solve several problems with RNNs most of which are centered around long inputs. Typical RNNs have trouble propagating its memory (the hidden state) through long inputs, so for inputs of say a paragraph of text an RNN will lose information from the beginning. These neural nets are also prone to vanishing and exploding gradients which LSTMs will also attempt to solve by implementing gates into the framework. These gates are a means for the neural network to forget irrelevant information and only remember what is truly important to whatever task it is being trained for. Therefore, it should seem fitting that our first gate is called a \"forget gate\". This gate will take the current input concatenated with the prior hidden state (call this concatenated vector $x_i+h_{i-1}$ and push it through a sigmoid function (effectively giving the neural net the ability to choose to \"forget\" certain aspects of either the input or the prior hidden state since these could either be squished to zero or retained close to one) call the output of this forget gate $f_i$. We then move to an input gate where $x_i+h_{i-1}$ is put through both a sigmoid and a tanh function which creates two vectors which are then multiplied point-wise together producing an output that we'll call $I_i$. $f_i$ is then multiplied pointwise with the previous cell's state giving a vector $l_i$ which is then added point-wise to $I_i$ which gives the cell state of our current cell $c_i$. This then takes us to the final gate: the output gate. This gate will first compute two vectors: first it finds $sigmoid(x_i+h_{i-1})$, then it computes $tanh(c_i)$. These two vectors are then multiplied together pointwise which gives the hidden state of this cell.\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "For this section I will use this tutorial from the pytorch documentation as a guide: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/sequence_models_tutorial.html. The first thing to note is that we can create an \"encoding\" that is trainable, where, rather than just one hot encoding each word into a vector, the program learns how to produce a useful encoding for this task (ie the encoding is trainable). The other major note is that since my neural net only needs to provide a single classification for the tweet as a whole (is there or is there not a disaster) we will only use the last output of the LSTM (ran through a sigmoid) to make our prediction.\n"

    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "LSTMs performed well for this task, but I wonder if there is a way to get more accuracy, for instance there might be misspelled words in the test data which might make classification difficult.\n",
    "## Changing Gears: TabNet\n",
    "I now want to learn how to use neural nets on yet another type of data: tabular data. To do this I will review Google's TabNet paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07442.pdf). This paper seeks to create a deep neural network that replicates important aspects from both tree-based methods for tabular data as well as advantages seen in fields like computer vision (like end-to-end deep learning). This is accomplished by leveraging intuition about how a neural net can be used to emulate a tree, as well as this idea of attention in deep learning. To start the authors give a motivating example of how a neural net can simulate a simple decision tree which uses a lot of the ideas that will come into play for the full model, so I think it is worth going into detail for this example (Figure 3 in the paper):\n",
    "### Aside: Using Neural Nets to Simulate Trees:\n",
    "Consider a set of tabular data with two columns labeled $(x_1, x_2)$ a decision tree will find a set of if-then statements that will determine how to classify points (eg: if $x_1 > 1$ and if $x_2 >1$ then classify $0$). These split points can be thought of as hyperplanes in many dimensions (or in our case a straight line on the $x_1$ $x_2$ plane like $x_1 = 1$). To replicate this behavior in a neural net we should take note that any split point (in the 2D example) is either a horizontal or vertical line (this is generalized later). This means that our neural net should output two vectors (in our case) that represent these decision boundaries (which can then be summed and softmaxed to give a prediction). These vectors will represent on which side of each decision boundary we are for each dimension (in this case 2 dimensions).  \n",
    " \n",
    "Consider a single input $(x_{1i},x_{2j})$ and two different neural nets each of which only see one of the features (again see figure 3 in the paper). This feature selection is accomplished using a mask which is a vector of size $D$ (where $D$ is the number of dimensions in your data) which will be elementwise multiplied with each row of your data. So, in our example to extract the first column our mask would contain a vector $(1,0)$ which, after multiplying with our input $(x_{1i},x_{2j})$, will give $(x_{1i},0)$. This means that our model will need two neural nets, one with a mask containing the vector $(1,0)$ before it and the other with a mask containing the vector $(0,1)$ before it. Let's quickly follow this example through one branch of our structure using the notation from the paper:  \n",
    " \n",
    "We start with an input $(x_{1i},x_{2j})$ which will be passed through our first mask producing $(x_{1i},0)$. This is then passed through a neural net whose output size should be the number of classes you are trying to classify. Since two lines (one vertical and one horizontal) can partition a 2D plane into four distinct sections we will make this neural net have 4 output neurons. However, since this neural net needs only to tell us if we are above or below the a line in $x_1$ space we only need to encode 1 input to two outputs (one of which will be non-zero if we are above the line and one which will be non-zero if we are below the line). Therefore, our weights should be a vector of $[C_1, -C_1, 0, 0]$ with biases $[-aC_1, aC_1, -1, -1]$ in order to produce this behavior. So after running our input $x_{1i}$ through this we will get this vector:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "C_1(x_{1i}-a)\\\\\n",
    "C_1(-x_{1i}+a)\\\\\n",
    "-1\\\\\n",
    "-1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Which is then passed through a ReLU function. Now, say that our line (that we are partitioning the $x_1,x_2$ plane with) is at $x_1 = 1$ to see how this vector indeed partitions our space consider a trained net with $a = 1$ and $C_1 > 0$ then, if $x_{1i} = 2$ our final vector would be:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "C_1(2-1)\\\\\n",
    "C_1(-2+1)\\\\\n",
    "-1\\\\\n",
    "-1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which, after applying the ReLU becomes:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "C_1\\\\\n",
    "0\\\\\n",
    "0\\\\\n",
    "0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "So every input $x_{1i} > 1$ will always produce a vector with only 1 non-zero component, and that component will always be the first element of the vector. This will work similarly with the second neural net except it will only produce vectors with non-zero components in the third and fourth positions. The outputs of these two neural nets are then added together which will give a vector with two non-zero elements, which will tell you exactly where $(x_{1i},x_{2j})$ is relative to our decision boundaries. Now, it is clear to see that this could generalize easily to lines in multiple dimensions (i.e. a diagonal line in the $x_1,x_2$ plane) it would just require more complex weights, biases, and masks. This is fundamentally the behavior that TabNet is trying to emulate, but with added complexity. Now, before we continue it is pertinent to know what attention is in a deep learning context.\n",
    "### Aside: Attention\n",
    "To get a better understanding of attention I will summarize this blog post on the topic in this section: https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitive-understanding-of-attention-mechanism-in-deep-learning-6c9482aecf4f. To properly summarize this article we can consider natural language processing again, as this is where the first attention mechanism was implemented. Consider again our LSTM network which takes a portion of an input (like a word of a sentence) and encodes it into both a hidden state and a cell state. For the purposes of this discussion consider a slightly different way of thinking where the hidden and cell states are the same state (which I will call the cell state). To do this would require a slight change in thinking, as well as a change to the internal gates of the LSTM block (these are called Gated recurrent units or GRUs, but I won't explain that for now), but for our purposes we can just think of each block or cell as something that takes a word in an outputs a single cell state. Now, we will consider translating a sentence with this network. More concretely, we want to take a sequence of words and turn it into another sequence of words with the same meaning in a different language. The way this problem was first solved was by taking the sequence of words and putting it through the first of two sequence models, and then using the output from the last cell in the first sequence model as the input to the second model to reconstruct the sentence in the target language. Using a diagram this looks like:  \n",
    " \n",
    "sentence -> model 1 -> output vector from the last cell of model 1 -> model 2 -> output of each cell in model 2 is a word in the translation, and we go until we get a special \"end translation\" character  \n",
    " \n",
    "This model runs into problems with memory, elements from the beginning of the sentence are lost, because we are only leveraging information from the very last cell of the first model. The way to solve this is to use all of the cell states across our whole first model, but how do we make the second model leverage all of the information while still understanding where it is in its translation? The answer is attention: for different stages of translation we want our second model to pay more attention to certain parts of the input. For instance, at the start of a translation you would pay more attention to the words in the beginning, which is exactly the behavior we want to replicate for this scheme. Using the notation from the article, we will first run the input sentence through our first model (the \"encoder\") which will produce a number of cell states $h_1,h_2,...,h_n$ which will then be fed into a fully connected neural net along with the previous state of the second model (the \"decoder\"). NOTE: if this is the first word to translate we will just feed the last cell state of the encoder in place of the state of the decoder. We do this because this lets the dense neural net know where in the translation we are, because the goal of this network is to output attention values (or how much attention we should pay each of the states $h_1,h_2,...,h_n$). This neural net calculates \"attention\" by giving an output of size n and having a softmax activation to get a list of probabilities $e_1,e_2,...,e_n$ that all represent the relative importance of each of the encoded states $h_1,h_2,...,h_n$. Element-wise multiplication of the $e$ vector and $h$ vector will then give the so-called \"context vector\" $e_1h_1, e_2h_2, ... , e_nh_n$. We then need to also tell the decoder exactly where we are in the translation so we will append a vector representing the last translated word to this context vector (or a special start character if this is the first word in the translation), and pass this concatenated vector to the decoder which will then give us our next word and cell state to be used in the cycle all over again.  \n",
    " \n",
    "To summarize: attention is a way of leveraging more data without getting overwhelmed by irrelevant details, but more relevantly it is a way of identifying what information is actually important for a given computation. But the question still remains: how does TabNet leverage this concept?\n",
    "### Attention in TabNet\n",
    "Moving back to the paper (to reiterate the source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07442.pdf) we return to the idea of masks, but we note that a mask is very similar to the vector $e_1,e_2,...,e_n$ that was output by the attention neural net in our translation example. This is, in fact, where the attention mechanism lies, everytime we apply a mask we are choosing a subset of parameters that we are considering 'relevant', and this, much like the translation example, will be trained. We can now talk about the two fundamental building blocks of this model: Feature Transformers and Attention Transformer. We will start with the latter:\n",
    "### Attention Transformers\n",
    "The goal of these transformers is to take a representation of the input from a feature transformer and turn it into a mask. Using the notation of the paper: we will use the feature transformer on the initial data, which has dimension $BxD$ where $B$ is the batch size and $D$ is the number of columns in our data, and transform it into a vector of size $BxN_a$. This is now passed to our attention transformer which will turn it into a mask of size $BxD$. With this goal in mind we can define the neural net at this point:  \n",
    " \n",
    "We start with a fully connected layer followed by batch normalization the output of which is multiplied by a \"prior scales\" function. This function is defined in the paper as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P[i] = \\Pi_{j=1}^i (\\gamma - M[j])\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where $\\gamma$ is a 'relaxation' parameter and $M[j]$ is the jth mask in our model. $P[0]$ is initialized to be all ones. This is then put through a function called a sparse max. I won't go into what exactly this is right now beyond saying that it is like softmax, but it tries to set low probabilities to zero without losing the desirable qualities of softmax (like differentiability). A good article on this topic can be found here: https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-sparsemax-f84c136624e4. Sparsemax is desirable here because we would like to totally exclude columns if we can, so this allows our mask to do that. After applying this activation we will have the mask that we will use for the next layer, and for the sake of efficiency one can update prior scales by multiplying the stored prior scales by $\\gamma - newMask$.\n",
    "### Feature Transformers\n",
    "These are built up from repeats of 3 layers: a fully connected layer, a batch normalization layer, and a gated linear unit non-linearity. In the paper each feature transformer was made of 4 repeats of these 3 layers, with residual connections between each layer, normalized by a coefficient of $\\sqrt{.5}$. The paper also notes that some of the layers in these transformers should be consistent across the whole network, so we must reuse a subset of these layers throughout the model. It is also noted that there is a split operation performed in these transformers. This is simply splitting the output of this transformer into a decision and an input to the attention transformer. The input to the attention transformer has size $N_a$ and output prediction (decision) for this step will have dimension $N_d$. An important implementation note is that all of the batch normalizations in the feature transformers are what are called ghost batch normalizations which I think are worth talking about:\n",
    "### Ghost Batch Normalization\n",
    "For this section I will review the paper that originally presented ghost batch normalization found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08741.pdf. To start let's detail a known problem in machine learning: the generalization gap. When using large batch sizes there is a 'degradation of generalization' in the performance of neural networks, in other words training accuracy might remain the same for large batch sizes, but there is a drop in accuracy on the test set (our model is not generalizing). This is not a problem for small batch sizes, but in order to use the full capability of modern GPUs the authors of the TabNet paper recommend using batch sizes as large as possible. Ghost batch normalization is one proposed solution to this problem. The paper on ghost mini batches (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08741.pdf) finds that the distance of the final weights from their initialization position grows logarithmically with the number of gradient descent steps. Intuitively, taking fewer steps in gradient descent should make the model less accurate, but this result shows that this problem can be much larger than one might anticipate. With this hypothesis they show that it is indeed the case that our \"generalization gap\" stems from not doing as many gradient descent steps when using a larger batch size. This is perhaps a slight simplification, so it is worth noting that small mini-batches have another desirable property: stochastic noise. Since the input is smaller a small mini-batch has a larger variance which (according to the paper) has been found to encourage the weights to move out of steep minima and more toward a global minima. To mitigate these problems they propose the method ghost batch normalization.  \n",
    " \n",
    "The goal of ghost batch normalization is to match the statistics of the step size when using a small batch. This will allow us to leverage all of the desirable properties of a small mini-batch for a large mini-batch. The way ghost batch normalization does this is by taking small \"ghost\" batches (using subsets of the mini-batch that it is processing), and does batch normalization on only those portions of the batch. For the training set it keeps track of the running average and standard deviation in the same way that normal batch normalization would to eventually use on the test set. This method should provide stochastic noise similar to that of small mini-batches, and the authors show that using it will close the generalization gap if we allow the model to perform more iterations of gradient descent.\n",
    "### Overall Structure of TabNet\n",
    "We now must consider the overall arrangement of transformers. To start, we receive data into our model, and we must first get our data's statistics under control. One of the advantages that the author's of TabNet outline is that this network is meant to run in so-called \"end-to-end\" deep learning, this means that we are assuming that we have not preprocessed our features in any way (other than making them numeric). This means that our features could be input with vastly different scales, and overall statistics, so the authors first get all of those things under control with a normal batch normalization layer. We then consider the first block of the model. The data is sent to a block with this structure:  \n",
    " \n",
    "Data (size $BxD$) -> Feature Transformer -> Output of Feature Transformer (size $BxN_a+N_d$) -> split (creates two outputs, one of size $BxN_d$ and one of size $BxN_a$) -> one of these outputs is not needed for this step, specifically the $BxN_d$ sized output -> Feed split's $BxN_a$ output into the attention transformer -> Outputs mask of size $BxD$.  \n",
    " \n",
    "From a qualitative perspective here's what's happening: the data is fed into the feature transformer which makes both a \"decision\" output ($BxN_d$) and an encoded representation of the data ($BxN_a$). In the first step we aren't making a decision, so we throw the decision output away. We then need to run the encoded features through the attention transformer. From this encoded representation the attention transformer figures out which features we need to pay the most attention to, and outputs a mask. It is also worth noting that the data we input to this layer is a copy of the data, because we need this data for each step of the model. This is then put into the next step of the model which is the real building block of the network. This step looks like this:  \n",
    " \n",
    "Data (size $BxD$) -> pointwise multiplication with a mask (output of previous attention transformer) -> Feature Transformer -> Output of Feature Transformer (size $BxN_a+N_d$) -> split  \n",
    " \n",
    "Each output of split now has a different path so we'll start by following the $BxN_d$ output:  \n",
    " \n",
    "Split output (size $BxN_d$) -> ReLU -> add this output point-wise with the output of all the block ahead of it in the network -> Fully Connected layer -> softmax  \n",
    " \n",
    "One can draw parallels between this scheme and residual learning in that we are sort of aggregating the outputs of many blocks together by adding them together. We will now follow the path of the other split output:  \n",
    " \n",
    "Split output (size $BxN_a$) -> attention transformer -> Mask  \n",
    " \n",
    "This is the same as it was for out first block. The next important part of the architecture is the ability for this model to give feature attribution.\n",
    "### Feature Attribution in TabNet\n",
    "In order to get the global importance of each feature to the decision of the model we need only to know the masks at each step, and the relative importance of each mask to the overall decision. Since we already have each mask (the output of the attention transformer) we just have to consider a way of gauging the relative importance of that mask to the final decision. To gauge this, the authors define an aggregation function (the box labeled \"Agg\" on figure 4 in the paper) as the sum of our decision matrix after we apply a ReLU non-linearity. More precisely: let the output of size $BxN_d$ after we apply the split operation to the output of a feature transformer be called $V_D$. To get the relative importance of a given mask we take $ReLU(V_D)$ and sum along each row to produce a vector $v_A$ of size $Bx1$. We can then take our mask $M_k$ (as the mask from the kth block of our model) of size $BxD$ and multiply each row by the corresponding row of $v_A$ which will give a matrix of the form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "m_{1,1}*v_1 &m_{1,2}*v_1  & ... & m_{1,D}*v_1\\\\\n",
    "m_{2,1}*v_2 &m_{2,2}*v_2  & ... & m_{2,D}*v_2 \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots  & ... & \\ddots   & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    " m_{B,1}*v_B& m_{B,2}*v_B & ... &m_{B,D}*v_B\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where $v_i$ is the ith element of $v_A$ and $m_{i,j}$ is the i,jth element of our mask $M_k$. If we call this new matrix $M_{new, k}$ we are almost done defining this aggregation. If our model has $N$ total decision blocks then we will let $M_{sum}$ be the point-wise sum of all of our $M_{new, k}$, in other words $\\sum_{n=1}^NM_{new,n} = M_{sum}$. Then, to create the often desirable property that each row sums to 1, we will normalize this by dividing each element of each row of $M_{sum}$ by its corresponding row sum. This will give a new mask that corresponds to the relative importance of each feature in the model for each batch. One can then take the mean across the batch dimension to get a global importance of each feature. The final aspect of training one of these neural nets is self-supervised learning.\n",
    "### Self-Supervised Learning\n",
    "Self-supervised learning simply refers to using the data itself to sort of 'pre-train' a neural net, so that it has an idea of how different features of the dataset interact before it has even begun trying to predict something. For instance, if we had a dataset that had two columns, marital status and relationship status, with values like \"married\" or \"not married\" for the first column and \"in a relationship\" or \"not in a relationship\" for the second, then given that someone is married it would have to follow that they were in a relationship, and if someone is not in a relationship it should follow that they are not married. This presents a learnable correlation of TabNet, and it would be advantageous for TabNet to have some idea about what this correlation is before it attempts any predictions.  \n",
    " \n",
    "To accomplish this the authors present a deceptively simple method. We are going to feed the model an incomplete dataset and try to make it predict values that we take out. This should teach the model correlations between columns without needing to generate more data. The way that we will do this is by taking our \"encoded\" representation (the output of TabNet) and feeding it into a decoder. More explicitly using the notation from the \"Overall Structure of TabNet'' section, we will take the end product of the $BxN_d$ path of split, put it through a dense layer with output size $BxD$ and put it through a feature decoder. This feature decoder will just be N blocks of this pattern:  \n",
    " \n",
    "Feature Transformer (output $BxN_a+N_d$) -> Fully Connected Layer (output $BxD$)  \n",
    " \n",
    "Since we are allowed to have N steps in this decoder we just take the ouput of each step and add them together to get the reconstructed features. Now, with all of the theory out of the way we can work on an implementation.\n"

We'll use the original paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02068.pdf) to figure out what sparse max is doing. \n",
    "##### The Forward Pass\n",
    "Sparse max is a function that maps vectors in $n$ dimensions to probabilities (specifically it maps these vectors to a probability simplex). Sparse max does this by finding the euclidean projection of a vector onto the probability simplex, which, the paper notes, has a high probability of hitting the boundary of the simplex which will make the resulting projection very sparse. This can be done in linear time with a simple algorithm (algorithm 1 in the paper, copied below):  \n",

This means that $k(z)$ is some integer between 1 and K, so the definition of $\\tau(z)$ should now make sense (at least enough to implement it). \n",
    "##### The Backward Pass\n",

This can actually be computed very quickly since we will have already calculated $S(z)$ (and implicitly $s$) in the forward pass. We can now implement this function, but to do so we will need to implement it as a new autograd function in Pytorch, a good tutorial for this can be found here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/examples_autograd/two_layer_net_custom_function.html"

    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "This accuracy is not quite as high as what we would expect from the library implementation, but I believe I've identified a couple of explanations for this discrepancy. First, the paper mentions that they use an automated method to select hyper parameters for their model which helped with their accuracy. It appears that the library I was using to compare my method to also uses some strange hyper-parameter defaults for their training (for instance, they use a non-standard momentum for the batch-normalization). Since I did not implement these I would expect to get a lower accuracy as my model does not have optimized hyperparameters. Second, the default size of the neural net for the library implementation is actually larger than mine (it has more decision steps). I would try changing this for my model, but due to inefficiencies in my code that the library implementation has found solutions to I am unable to train a larger neural network on this data, and since my end accuracy was only 8% lower than theirs I believe that my implementation is working, just not as well or as fast of the library version. A few notes: I have assumed that the data that is fed into the model will be divisible by the batch size. This is because our attention transformers create masks of a given size, and the prior scales function depends on that dimension. There are ways around this, but the paper doesn't mention a solution for this particular problem, and I didn't want to try anything incorrect for the implementation. That said, I did put something into the code where it might run with a changing batch size, but it does break the math a little (though I did not test this extensively). Overall, this was a great exercise for me, and I learned a lot by doing it.\n"

Before I get into an implementation using the complete MNIST dataset I will summarize a course from Google on the topic: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/problems. Mode collapse is the tendency for the generator to find a single optimal output and always give that output. This is possible if the discriminator becomes stuck in a local minima, making it impossible for it to learn how to combat the generator's strategy. This course says that using Wasserstein loss is already a step in the right direction for combating this problem, so I'll try running what I've already coded on the complete data set and see if it works.\n"

    "### Final Thoughts on GANs Using the Complete Dataset\n",
    "It doesn't appear to converge to a single solution, and this is probably due to the fact that I am using Wasserstein loss. I could probably get the mode collapse behavior if I used the original paper's loss, or maybe just a more complex dataset, but for now I think that my implementation is somewhat stable for this data set. It does seem to take longer to converge to a consistently good solution, a lot of the things it prints seem to be mixes of multiple digits rather than 1 cohesive digit.\n"

    "## Summary of this Progress Report\n",
    "In this progress report I learned how to apply deep learning techniques to 2 more types of data: sequential (text) and tabular. LSTMs presented an interesting solution to sequential models’ tendency to \"forget\" the beginning of an input sequence through their use of gates which allowed them to curate what information they thought was important throughout the model. This exercise was not only useful for my own learning, but also helped me understand attention in neural networks. I then turned to implementing TabNet which uses ideas from many different domains in machine learning to provide a framework for working with tabular data using deep learning. It did this through an attention mechanism that allowed the neural net to simulate a decision tree through the use of masks. I had originally intended to do more \"exploitation\" of techniques this week, but implementing TabNet turned out to be a much larger undertaking than I had originally thought, involving multiple papers, a new layer type (see ghost batch normalization), and a new activation function (see sparse max), so I ran out of time. I hope next week to apply some of these techniques to data that interests me and pertains to my research outside of class, but for this week I believe that this work is sufficient. Additionally, I quickly addressed feedback with my previous biweekly report by learning how to read and access the CIFAR-10 data set and running my GAN on the complete MNIST data set, which did not exhibit mode collapse due to my use of Wasserstein loss.\n"
