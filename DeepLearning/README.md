# Biweekly Report 1
In this biweekly report I teach myself Pytorch, and make a basic classifier (in the style of LeNET). After this I implement a generative advisarial neural network in Pytorch, and so-called "dense nets" both of which I explain in the report.
# Biweekly Report 2
In this report I implement a basic LSTM model for disaster tweet classification as well as TabNet, an architecture by engineers from Google that is meant to be a way for deep learning to work with tabular data. 
# Biweekly Report 3
This is in a directory since I decided to split the report into multiple parts. This report includes comparing several models against data that interests me, image to image translation, and EDA on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
