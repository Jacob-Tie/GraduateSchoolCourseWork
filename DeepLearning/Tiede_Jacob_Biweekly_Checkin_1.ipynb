    "## Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) in Pytorch\n",
    "For a more complex application of Pytorch I will again use the MNST data to create a generative adversarial neural network that creates digits. To start we'll detail what a GAN is.\n",
    "### What is the General Structure of a GAN\n",
    "To get a general idea of what a GAN is and how to use it I will briefly summarize this article: https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/. The article details two general types of GANs, the first being a \"typical\" GAN, and the second being a more advanced \"conditional\" GAN. Since I have never learned about or implemented a GAN I will focus on the simpler \"typical\" GAN rather than the \"conditional\" GAN. In general, these networks contain two neural networks, the first being a \"discriminator\" and the second being a \"generator\". The discriminator's job is simply to determine if an image is real (from the original dataset) or fake (not from the original data set). The generator's job is then to create examples (using randomly generated numbers from the so called \"latent\" space) that trick the discriminator into believing that the images are actually from the dataset. The trick is, the generator never sees any examples from the real dataset, it must wholly rely on feedback from the discriminator. Generally, this means that the scheme for training these nets is to feed the discriminator examples from both the real dataset and the generator and train it to discriminate these, then tell the generator how well it is doing based on how convincing its generated examples were to the discriminator. This means that the loss of our generator is actually implicitly defined interms of another neural network, which is certainly an interesting way of solving this problem. With that brief explanation let's get into some of the details of this implementation.\n",
    "### The Loss Functions\n",
    "To get a better understanding of the original loss function we will first look at the original paper that detailed GANs (found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf). According to the paper we update the discriminator using the following loss function:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}log(D(x^{(i)})) +log(1-(D(G(z^{(i)})))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where $m$ is the number of examples in a mini-batch $D(x)$ is the discriminator evaluated on a mini-batch of images x, $G(z)$ is a mini-batch of images generated by the generator given a noise input z, then $x^{(i)}$ and $z^{(i)}$ are just specific instances of either images in the actual data set or noise generated for a particular mini-batch. One interesting aspect of this scheme is that we would actually like to maximize this function. This should make sense if one considers $D(x)$ as a probability that the image x belongs to the data set (it is not fake). This means that a in a good discriminator we would have $log(D(x^{(i)})) \\approx log(1) = 0$ and $log(1-(D(G(z^{(i)}))) \\approx log(1 - 0) = 0$ and since $log(1-(D(G(z^{(i)}))) < 0$ if the discriminator is even partially fooled (in fact if our discriminator is very bad then we can see $log(1-(D(G(z^{(i)}))) \\approx log(1-.99999999...) \\rightarrow -\\infty$), which implies that in order to make a good discriminator we would like to preform gradient ascent on the above function, or equivalently we can do gradient descent on:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{-1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}log(D(x^{(i)})) +log(1-(D(G(z^{(i)})))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Next, the paper details the loss function for the generator as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}log(1-(D(G(z^{(i)})))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Which we would like to minimize (for similar reasons to the previous paragraph, a good generator would fool the discriminator so $log(1-(D(G(z^{(i)}))) \\approx log(1-1) \\rightarrow -\\infty$ which is the min of this function since the discriminator outputs a probability).\n",
    "### Are these the Best Loss Choices?\n",
    "Like with many things in Deep Learning it appears that the first iteration could be improved upon, so I'll briefly go over one other loss (closely related to the one I just detailed only with a slight change in thinking), and then I'll explain a more drastically different loss that preforms much better than either of the others. The first improvement (detailed through a course from google: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/loss, and I believe later in the original paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf) will change the way we view the original loss. The original paper mentions that using the loss $\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}log(1-(D(G(z^{(i)})))$ for the generator might make the generator neural net stop learning early (because the discriminators job is too easy so it converges on a good solution too fast), and their suggested fix was to instead maximize $log(D(G(z)))$ (or equivalently minimize $-log(D(G(z)))$). Practically speaking this means that we are maximizing the probability that D is fooled instead of minimizing that probability that D is not fooled (which is the interpretation of the original loss). However, this still isn't the best loss to use. The linked course from Google describes Wasserstein loss, which will further mitigate the problem of stopping training prematurely. This loss first requires a modification to the discriminator (now called a \"critic\"): it must output any real number instead of a number constrained to be between 0 and 1. I will provide an explanation for why I believe this change is warranted, but the linked course does not describe this theoretical link (so I'll make a guess at why). This then allows us to redefine the losses as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D(x)-D(G(z))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "For the critic, and\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D(G(z))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "for the generator. Both of these losses are to be maximized under this scheme, which will force the critic to output a large number if the instance is real and a small (or negative) number if it is fake. Theoretically, I think this loss eliminates the problem of having a $log$ in the loss function. In the prior scheme the log had a singularity for a finite input, meaning if the discriminator is very good (which it tends to be in the beginning because it is pretty easy to discriminate between the images of a barely trained generator and real images) we get a loss of infinity. Removing the log removes the possibility that a very good discriminator can give the generator a loss of infinity.\n",
    "### Architecture and Implementation of this Neural Net\n",
    "For this final section I will make use of many of the implementation notes found in this blog post: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-code-a-wasserstein-generative-adversarial-network-wgan-from-scratch/. I'll detail the general neural net structure and some of the most important features, but first I think it is important to quickly talk about one of the most important elements of this network: transposed convolutions:\n",
    "#### Aside: Transposed Convolutions\n",
    "In general, a transposed convolution is an upsampling technique that uses trainable parameters to do upsampling. Unlike methods like unpooling (which algorithmically upsample an image) transposed convolutions use kernels similar to convolutional neural nets to address the same problem, except it will take each pixel of the image and map it to more pixels of the output image. For instance a 2x2 kernel in a transposed convolution will take every pixel of the input image and map that pixel to a 2x2 region of the output image (adding any overlapping regions together). For more detail this is a good article on the topic: https://towardsdatascience.com/transposed-convolution-demystified-84ca81b4baba.\n",
    "#### The Neural Network's Architecture\n",
    "The discriminator is structured similarly to classification nets that we have gone over in class, so I will just give the structure:  \n",
    " \n",
    "The article's implementation of the discriminator: 2DConvolution with 64 4x4 filters, same padding, stride 2 -> Batch normalization -> leaky ReLU -> 2DConvolution with 64 4x4 filters, same padding, stride 2 -> Batch normalization -> leaky ReLU -> Dense layer with a single neuron as output.  \n",
    " \n",
    "This implementation is somewhat difficult in pytorch since same padding is more easily defined for odd filter sizes (and since Pytorch doesn't have a padding = 'same' option so I am the one who will have to figure out the padding size). To this end I'll list the discriminator that I am going to implement:  \n",
    " \n",
    "My implementation of the discriminator: 2DConvolution with 64 3x3 filters, same padding, stride 2 -> Batch normalization -> leaky ReLU -> 2DConvolution with 64 3x3 filters, same padding, stride 2 -> Batch normalization -> leaky ReLU -> Dense layer with a single neuron as output.  \n",
    " \n",
    "Now, the generator's implementation is a little more complex, because it needs to take randomly generated points in the latent space and turn them into images. This is a lot of dimensional book keeping which I will summarize:  \n",
    " \n",
    "The article's implementation of the generator: A dense layer with $128*7*7$ nodes -> reshape this into image like data with 128 channels of 7x7 \"images\" -> transposed convolution with 4x4 filters, same padding and stride 2, this upscales to a 14x14 image -> Batch normalization -> leaky ReLU -> transposed convolution with 4x4 filters, same padding and stride 2 this upscales to a 28x28 image-> Batch normalization -> leaky ReLU -> 2D convolution with 1 7x7 filter and same padding, this collapses everything into a single image -> tanh activation  \n",
    "#### Other Implementation notes\n",
    "The training data that I am using is only of the digit '4'. When extracting samples of data from the training data we must rescale them to be between -1 and 1 (since our generator's activation forces it to generate images within this range), because otherwise the critic's job is too easy. The gradient descent algorithm used is RMSprop according to the article. Weight clipping is required for the critic. The critic has to be trained more often than the generator to prevent the model from converging to a bad solution.\n"

    "## Improving our Predictive Power with Residual Neural Networks (Res Nets)\n",
    "### Defining a ResNet\n",
    "For this section I will be summarizing this article: https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-resnets-c0a830a288a4. A goal of mine has been to truly solve the \"Hello World\" of image classification problems: to classify handwritten digits. To truly solve this problem I think I should be able to get higher accuracy than even the deepest convolutional neural networks. Fortunately there is a deceptively simple way to get a little more accuracy than the traditional models of Alex net and LeNet: residual neural networks. The problem with traditional convolutional nets (as the blog post states) is that they don't actually continue to get more accurate with more layers. In fact, the opposite begins to happen. With more complexity from added layers the traditional convolutional net will begin to perform worse than their less complex counterparts. One way to solve this is through residual learning. These layers (or residual blocks as they are sometimes referred to) are basically layers that \"remember\" a prior input by adding it's activation to an output of a later layer. For example, say you had a convolutional layer that looked like this:  \n",
    " \n",
    "Input -> Convolution -> output -> g(output)  \n",
    " \n",
    "A residual block would record the activation of the input layer, then the final non-linearity g would become g(output + input). One way to mathematically think about this is to call the input $x$ a tensor of shape ($C$ x $N$ x $M$), note that there could also be a batch size dimension, but for simplicity I have omitted that. Then our convolution would apply some kind weight matrix $W$ and non-linearity to our input $x$, followed by a non-linearity $g$, so the output could be written as $output = g(x,W)$. With the skip connection we can attain a final output as $y_{output} = g(x,W) + W_sx$ where $W_s$ is a tensor that will transform the shape of $x$ to match that of $g(x,W)$. Now, one way to think of why it helps is that it appears that it is very easy for the neural net to learn the identity function. It is very easy for $W$ to be set to zero and $W_s$ to be the identity tensor thus making the convolution layer irrelevant. This means that if the model doesn't believe that a particular layer is useful it can just skip it rather than having to learn an extremely complex function, but it also has an advantage over not including this convolution layer since the net might still learn something useful from it. This translates to residual layers giving the potential to learn useful features, but not making the model needlessly complex. It should also follow that we can make the model deeper without sacrificing accuracy under this scheme, and this is the trend observed in the article.\n",
    "### A More Modern Variant of Res Net: Dense Net\n",
    "For this section I will detail an slightly newer variant of Res Net: Dense Net (as detailed in this article: https://towardsdatascience.com/an-overview-of-resnet-and-its-variants-5281e2f56035). This is a slight alteration that relies not on addition, but concatenation. To start let's define a concatenation operation:\n",
    "#### Concatenation\n",
    "Concatenation is simply appending along a dimension. For our purposes this dimension will always be the 'channels' dimension. For example, let's say that you have two tensors $x$ and $y$ whose dimensions are both $(Channels, Height, Width)$ then the concatenation of $x$ and $y$ along their $Channels$ dimension would produce a tensor $z$ of dimension $(2*Channels, Height, Width)$. This naturally leads into the definition of a 'dense block' in our dense net:\n",
    "#### Dense Block\n",
    "A good picture of this can be found in the article, but I will do my best to explain in words. To start we will have an input of size $(C, H, W)$ where $C$ is the number of channels in the input, $H$ is the height of the image, and $W$ is the width of the image that is saved into memory. We then put this through a set of convolutions that typically follow the pattern:  \n",

    "The 1x1 Convolution (sometimes called a 'bottle-neck' layer) is used to reduce the number of channels that are input into the 3x3 Convolution (because we'll see this could get very high, though not in the first layer). The output of this layer is then concatenated with the input along the $C$ dimension creating a new tensor with dimension $(C+3x3C, H, W)$ where $3x3C$ is the number of channels that the 3x3 convolution outputs. In general, the output of a given 3x3 convolution in this block will be concatenated with all of the previous 3x3 convolution's outputs as well as the input, so for the $n$th 3x3 convolution we will get a tensor of dimension $(C+3x3C*n, H, W)$ after the concatenation. This scheme allows our model to more easily propagate features through the neural net since we are directly providing all of the previous learned features to every other stage of the block. As a note, due to how we have defined our concatenation steps the dimensions $H$ and $W$ must remain the same throughout this block, so the only time that we can apply pooling in this scheme are the so-called transition layers.\n",
    "#### Transition Layers\n",
    "These layers allow us to apply pooling to reduce the dimension of our data. These layers are not connected to other layers through concatenation like within the dense block, so there is no need to retain the dimensions $H$ and $W$. However, given the potentially large number of channels in the output of a dense block we must first apply a 1x1 convolution to the dense block output to reduce this number. So, in general, a transition layer will look something like this:  \n",

    "1x1 convolution -> pooling  \n",
    " \n",
    "Note: the degree to which this 1x1 convolution reduces the channel dimension is called the compression factor.\n",
    "#### Other Implementation Notes\n",
    "The final layer (before a fully connected layer with a softmax activation used for the classification itself) has a global pool operation. The original implementation of dense net used average pooling for its transition layers, I've opted for max pooling since this has given me substantially better accuracy on the test set. Also, from what I can tell from the article, within the dense blocks there is no activation or batch normalization of the 1x1 convolution before it is passed to the 3x3 convolution. I've included these since it appears they increase the accuracy of the model on the test set. I've also opted to use a global max pool rather than a global average pool in the final layer since this also appears to increase the accuracy. I'm not entirely sure why this is, but I can try to speculate. I think that there are so many filters in the end that it is easier for the net to converge to a useful solution if it only needs to worry about ensureing that the largest value in the final filter is correct rather than a combination of numbers. I believe that average pooling would probably converge to a good solution with more training, but I don't think my computer is fast enough to get there. Finally, it is worth noting that I've included dropout layers in the dense blocks to try and mitigate overfitting in the model. These have a small probability, and are only applied to bottle neck layers in the block (this is because they feed almost directly into the 3x3 convolution blocks, so I think zeroing out some of the nodes on the 1x1 convolution will also make the 3x3 layer less prone to over fitting. I didn't want to include it on both because I would rather not have a lot of dropout on convolution layers if I can help it, and this solution seemed to work fine)."

    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "This classifier is at least comparable if not better than one from the original Pytorch tutorial, though I still suspect that average pooling would eventually converge to an even better solution. Again, average pooling will probably be able to get a better solution eventually, but it is too slow to converge for my computer.\n",
    "## Summary for this Progress Report\n",
    "In this progress report I learned to use Pytorch by completing a tutorial, and a couple of projects using the framework. In the tutorial I learned the basics of creating tensors, and implementing neural nets. During the Generative Advisarial Neural Net portion I learned to use custom loss functions and how to adjust the training loop to fit a difficult model. Finally, I was able to implement complex custom layers (in the form of dense blocks) in the Residual Network section."
